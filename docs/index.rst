What is IATI Tables?
====================

The `IATI Standard <https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/>`_ is in XML format,
so the data cannot be directly loaded into a database or data analysis tool.
`IATI Tables <https://iati-tables.codeforiati.org/>`_ solves this problem by transforming
IATI data into relational tables and making it available to users in multiple output formats.
